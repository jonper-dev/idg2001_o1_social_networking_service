# IDG2001 - Report on Assignment 2
## Basic information
* Task: Improve the Social Media Service, "Twitter from Temu", into a "First Price Twitter".
* Title: Cheeper [another bird sound, also sounds like "cheaper" which fits.]

## New technologies
### Docker 
We decided to move our development server over to Docker for easier development and testing. 

#### Running project with Docker (local server) 
1. Make sure an .env with database credentials are included in the root of the project directory
2. Run "docker compose up --build" in terminal
3. Run Visual Stuio Code Live Server of "index.html"
